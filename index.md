# About Me

I'm a fifth year Physics graduate student at University of California at Berkeley. My work has mainly focused on understanding the distribution of "stuff" in the universe (the "large scale structure") and using that information to make inferences about underlying physics. Much of my recent work has focused on developing statistical methods to reconstruct distant cosmic structures through a variety of probes.

In addition to my work in physics, I'm deeply involved with "Splash" educational outreach/enrichment programs where university students teach short classes on non-standard topics to area high school and middle school students. Classes can be on anything ranging from the physics of black holes to german fairy tales. Students get to learn about things that they normally wouldn't have access to and empower them to find new passions. Through the national umberella organization, Learning Unlimited, I've mentored students at UC Berkeley, UC Merced, Oxford University, Bard College, and Nothwestern University to run their own successful program. 

# Current Research Focus

## Reconstructing the Large Scale Structure of the Universe

The distribution of matter in the universe holds a wealth of information about the fundemental nature of the cosmos. As time moves forward, structure evolve under the force of gravity given their initial conditions from the early universe. By understanding the current distributon of matter, we can rewind back time to study the initial conditions as well as constrain the gravitational evolution itself. 

Some of my recent papers have been focused on understanding this
